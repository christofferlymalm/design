About this project
==================

A website based on my university teacher's PHP framework. Languages used in this project are PHP, CSS, LESS, Markdown, HTML, etc. The purpose of this project was to learn different design patterns and design elements with focus on UX. The visual design was made in LESS modules and then compiled to a single CSS file. On this website, you can find reports that analyze different design concepts.
